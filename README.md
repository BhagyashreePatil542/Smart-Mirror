//Smart-Mirror using IOT
A virtual Smart Mirror prototype built with Tinkercad Circuits, simulating real-time IoT features like temperature display.

Features:
->LCD display for time, temperature.
->Fully simulated in TinkerCad(No physical hardware is required)
->Modular and expanded design

Simulation is through TinkerCad Circuits, 
MicroController used is Arduino Uno, 
Components used are DHT11, LCD, LEDs.

///Prerequisites
->Basic Knowledge of Arduino
->Internet Browser(Chrome is recommmended)

///Simulation steps
->Open the TinkerCad(Smart-Mirror Using IOT in TinkerCad)
->Click on start simulation
->Observe sensor readings and LCD output
